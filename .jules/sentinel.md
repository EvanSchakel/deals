## 2025-05-04 - Terminal Output Spoofing in CLI App
**Vulnerability:** Command-line tool accepted and printed user input containing ANSI escape sequences, allowing terminal injection and output spoofing (e.g., hiding actual output and printing forged, high-deal-score outputs).
**Learning:** Terminal applications need to treat all user-provided text as untrusted. The standard library doesn't automatically escape ANSI sequences for `sys.stdout`. Output coloring/formatting must be done around sanitized text.
**Prevention:** Filter out ANSI escape sequences (CSI commands) and non-whitespace control characters from all user-controlled inputs upon ingestion, before any processing or output mapping.
